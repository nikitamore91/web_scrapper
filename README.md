Hi user,

This is a simple python code that will allow you to scrap images of any object from google without opening a browser.
However be aware, running this script multiple times may lead to blocking your IP address by GOOGLE.
It's just a fun code. It can be modified for other URLS as well. Just change string in URL variable.

You will need to download requests and bs4 modules using pip install.
Example: $pip install requests \n
         $pip install bs4
         
then simply run the script.
